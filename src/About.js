                  Hi, I'm Hugo Thompson, I'm a Software Engineer. I started my coding journey about halfway through high school, where I found a game that had a repository anyone could contribute to. I thought the idea of that was really cool and so I self learned a bit of the language to contribute myself. It was super fun to deliver new features, patch bugs, and rework mechanics for players and get fun positive feedback! This continued until I graduated, and while originally I was going to go ahead into collegeâ€¦ both my enjoyment of coding and covid hitting at a real nasty time made me decide to instead continue my self learning instead of dealing with online college classes at full price. I self learned some more for about two years, branched out a little bit into python and a bit of typescript for interest, but I still felt a little unsure about fully lacking any kind of formal education, so instead I joined code fellows to become a proper software developer. I'm currently learning there to fill in the holes, learn the industry, and build connections!

                  Hello my name is Marta Deneke , I am originally from Ethiopia. I
                  received my bachelor's in MIS in 2020. Since, the pandemic had
                  just started right before my graduation I had a difficult time
                  finding a job. So I started to look into becoming a software
                  engineer and researched different boot camps. Then, I joined
                  Code Fellows in November. While attending Western Washington
                  University, I worked and volunteered at various companies in
                  order to find my true passion. As a first generation college
                  graduate I have faced different challenges to be where I am
                  today and once I land my dream job and become a Software
                  Engineer I would like to start a nonprofit in Ethiopia for young
                  women that are interested in tech but don't know where to start.

                  Hello, my name is Danny. I recently was managing a warehouse for
                  over 5 years and decided I needed a change. For most of my life
                  I've been involved in music, be it writing, producing , and/or
                  performing. Needless to say I have a strong creative side and
                  wanted to express myself in a different medium. Software
                  development allows just that. My friend was a drummer in my band
                  and took on coding and suggested I looked into it and so I did.
                  The creative process is a lot like writing music in software
                  development. I work well with teams and love to motivate people
                  and bring them together in achieving one goal. I believe my
                  management skills along with my creative side I will be able to
                  be an asset in a team environment. Taking classes in codeFellows
                  and creating a page that I'm actually proud of has giving me the
                  drive I need to continue exploring this path.
